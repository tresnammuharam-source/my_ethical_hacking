# my paths by test is Penetration Tester

You may hear penetration testing referred to as "pentesting" or "ethical hacking". A penetration tester’s job is to check how secure a company’s systems and software are by safely trying to break into them. They look for weaknesses and vulnerabilities, then attempt to exploit them, just like a real hacker would, however, in a controlled manner, via a set of established rules between the organisation and the pentester.

## Responsibilities
- Test the security of  computer systems, networks, and web-based applications
- Perform security assessments, audits, and analyse security policies
- Analyse the results and create reports, advising an organisation on how to prevent the attack from occurring.
