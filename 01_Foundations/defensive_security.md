# Defensive security focuses on detecting and investigating attacks, and responding before damage occurs.

## Fundamental
- Unlike offensive security, you do not attack systems, instead, you monitor and protect them.
- How to work is Detect and Respond to attacks.
- Once suspicious activity is determined, defenders need to understand what kind of attack it is.
- The monitoring dashboard shows what the attacker is trying to find. We can use this information to better secure our systems, stop the attacker and prevent this attack from occuring again.
- We can stop the attacker from continuing on immediately while we investigate and fix any security vulnerabilities. This is known as containment.

## Main goal of defensive security
- Detect Suspicious Activity
- Identify the Attack
- Stop the Attack

## How to Do Detect Suspicious Activity
- Defenders use tools similar to this monitoring dashboard to decide what activity needs investigating
- Open the monitoring dashboard
- Review recent alerts
- Identify the suspicious source IP

## How to Do Identify the Attack
- Investigate the attack that has occured.
- View the "URL Discovery Attempts" list.
- Look at the latest "URL Discovery Attempts" entry to answer the question.

## How to Do Stop the Attack
- Block the attacker's IP address
- Apply rate limits, so any one else cannot overwhelm the system
- Update security rules
- Apply additional security measures to prevent this occuring again.
