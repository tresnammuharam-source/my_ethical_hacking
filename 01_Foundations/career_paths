Cybersecurity has many career paths, from breaking into systems (offensive security) to defending organisations from attacks (defensive security).

You don’t need a specific background to start. If you enjoy solving problems, being curious, or understanding how things work, you’ll likely find a role that fits you.

Why get a career in cyber:
- High demand: over 3.5 million unfilled roles.
- Strong salaries: competitive pay even at entry level.
- Constant learning: the field evolves fast.
