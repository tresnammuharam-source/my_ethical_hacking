# HYDRA

Hydra is a brute force online password cracking program, a quick system login password “hacking” tool.

Hydra can run through a list and “brute force” some authentication services. Imagine trying to manually guess someone’s password on a particular service (SSH, Web Application Form, FTP or SNMP) -
we can use Hydra to run through a password list and speed this process up for us, determining the correct password.

According to its official repository (`https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra`), Hydra supports, i.e., has the ability to brute force the following protocols: “Asterisk, AFP, Cisco AAA, Cisco auth, Cisco enable, CVS, Firebird,
FTP, HTTP-FORM-GET, HTTP-FORM-POST, HTTP-GET, HTTP-HEAD, HTTP-POST, HTTP-PROXY, HTTPS-FORM-GET, HTTPS-FORM-POST, HTTPS-GET, HTTPS-HEAD, HTTPS-POST,
HTTP-Proxy, ICQ, IMAP, IRC, LDAP, MEMCACHED, MONGODB, MS-SQL, MYSQL, NCP, NNTP, Oracle Listener, Oracle SID, Oracle, PC-Anywhere, PCNFS, POP3, POSTGRES,
Radmin, RDP, Rexec, Rlogin, Rsh, RTSP, SAP/R3, SIP, SMB, SMTP, SMTP Enum, SNMP v1+v2+v3, SOCKS5, SSH (v1 and v2), SSHKEY, Subversion, TeamSpeak (TS2), Telnet, VMware-Auth, VNC and XMPP.”

For more information on the options of each protocol in Hydra, you can check the Kali Hydra tool page( `https://en.kali.tools/?p=220` ).

This shows the importance of using a strong password; if your password is common, doesn’t contain special characters and is not above eight characters, it will be prone to be guessed.
A one-hundred-million-password list contains common passwords, so when an out-of-the-box application uses an easy password to log in,
change it from the default! CCTV cameras and web frameworks often use admin:password as the default login credentials, which is obviously not strong enough.

## Hydra Command

The options we pass into Hydra depend on which service (protocol) we’re attacking. For example, if we wanted to brute force FTP with the username being user and a password list being passlist.txt, we’d use the following command:

> hydra -l user -P passlist.txt ftp://10.48.171.79

## SSH

> hydra -l <username> -P <full path to pass> 10.48.171.79 -t 4 ssh

For example, `hydra -l root -P passwords.txt 10.48.171.79 -t 4 ssh` will run with the following arguments:

- Hydra will use root as the username for ssh
- It will try the passwords in the passwords.txt file
- There will be four threads running in parallel as indicated by -t 4

## Post Web Form

We can use Hydra to brute force web forms, too. You must know which type of request it is making; GET or POST methods are commonly used.
You can use your browser’s network tab (in developer tools) to see the request types or view the source code.

> sudo hydra <username> <wordlist> 10.48.171.79 http-post-form "<path>:<login_credentials>:<invalid_response>"

Below is a more concrete example Hydra command to brute force a POST login form:

> hydra -l <username> -P <wordlist> 10.48.171.79 http-post-form "/:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:F=incorrect" -V

- The login page is only /, i.e., the main IP address.
- The username is the form field where the username is entered
- The specified username(s) will replace ^USER^
- The password is the form field where the password is entered
- The provided passwords will be replacing ^PASS^
- Finally, F=incorrect is a string that appears in the server reply when the login fails

On a side note, if the web server is listening on a non-default port number, you can explicitly specify the port number using -s <port>, for example:

> hydra -l <username> -P <wordlist> 10.48.171.79 http-post-form "/:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:F=incorrect" -s <port> -V
