# Ethical Hacking & Cyber Security Journey

## About Me
Documenting my hands-on journey in Ethical Hacking, penetration testing, and cyber security fundamentals. Learning, breaking, and securing systems responsibly.

I am currently transitioning into Cyber Security with a strong focus on Ethical Hacking, penetration testing, and security analysis.  
This repository documents my structured learning journey, hands-on labs, write-ups, and technical experiments as I build both offensive and defensive security skills.

My objective is to become a professional Cyber Security practitioner who understands not only how systems are exploited, but also how they are secured.

## Write-Up Philosophy
Each lab or challenge includes:
- Objective
- Enumeration process
- Tools used
- Exploitation steps
- Root cause analysis
- Mitigation strategy

I document not only "how" something was exploited, but also "why" it was vulnerable.

---

## Current Focus

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
All activities documented in this repository are performed in legal environments such as learning platforms, virtual labs, or intentionally vulnerable machines.

Ethical conduct and responsible disclosure are core principles of my learning journey.
